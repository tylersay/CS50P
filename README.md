# CS50P
This is Tyler's answers to the problem sets for [CS50P (2022) Harvard OpenCourseWare](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/).
I wrote this repo to have a recap of course topics each week, and the required work for problem sets.


#### Tips if you're taking the course:
1. Personal preference, I used VS Code on desktop, the browser version seems slower. 
2. Go through the videos while attempting the lecture examples with the instructor. (not just passively watching the video) 
3. Try different ways to write the program, or even try break the program.
4. Have fun incorporating your own style to the problem sets, many ways to skin the proverbial cat.
5. Please do not submit my answers as yours, gentle reminder for the course's [academic honesty policy here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/honesty/)

## Week 0 - Functions, Variables
The first program every budding programing writes, "Hello , World".

#### Problem sets: 
- Indoor Voice: <br>
string methods - caps to no caps
- Playback Speed:<br>
string methods - replace
- Making Faces:<br>
string methods - replace
- Einstein:<br>
input function; int arithmetic
- Tip Calculator:<br>
input function; string methods - remove prefix; int arithmetic
<br><br>

## Week 1 - Conditionals
if, elif, else, <>, <= >=, ==, !=, match, case

#### Problem sets: 
- Deep Thought:
more str methods; if else; ==
- Home Federal Savings Bank:
if elif else
- File Extensions:
str methods; conditionals
- Math Interpreter:
str split to multiple delimiters; int arithmatic
- Meal Time
str split to multiple delimiters; int arithmatic
<br><br>

## Week 2 - Loops
while, for _ in range, <br>
lists, len(), <br>
dict, for xx in xxx <br>

#### Problem sets: 
- camelCase:<br>
iterate str as a list; str methods
- Coke Machine:<br>
while;
- Just setting up my twttr:<br>
for x in xx
- Vanity Plates:<br>
iterate str as a list; lots of conditionals revision
- Nutrition Facts:<br>
dict iterating
<br><br>

## Week 3 - Exceptions
try-except-else blocks, <br>
while True,<br>
pass break, <br>
(ValueError, ZeroDivisionError)<br>

#### Problem sets:
- Fuel Gauge:<br>
try-except-else blocks; while True; pass break;(ValueError, ZeroDivisionError)
- Felipe’s Taqueria:<br>
EOFError, dict
- Grocery List:<br>
add to dict; sort dict using key=lambda
- Outdated:<br>
compare inputs to list using conditionals, try-except-else
<br><br>

## Week 4 - Librarys
random, statistics, sys.argv, sys.exit<br>
requests, json - iterating jsons as dicts<br>

#### Problem sets:
- Emojize:
basic using emoji library
- Frank, Ian and Glen’s Letters:
sys.argv; figlet library
- Adieu, Adieu:
inflect library, append inputs to list
- Guessing Game:
random library, 
- Little Professor:
more while loops and logical conditionals.<br>
i'm really happy with the way my code can be extrapolated
- Bitcoin Price Index:
request library, parse JSON dict


## Week 5 - Unit Tests
test code: assert function's return value
pytest library: test Errors

Problem Sets:
- Testing my twittr:
assert strings
- Back to the Bank:
assert ints
- Re-requesting a Vanity Plate:
assert True/False
- Refueling:
assert nested functions,
pytest.raises Errors


## Week 6 - File I/O
open/edit files, and create output files<br>
open(), file.write(), file.close()<br>
with open() as file:  *this one close file automatically* <br>
csv library, csv.DictReader and writing csv<br>
PIL library, binary files and images(and gifs)

#### Problem Sets:
- Lines of Code:<br>
count num of lines of code in inputfile (ignore spaces and comments);<br>
try block, with open, readlines method
- Pizza Py:<br>
csv library; tabulate library; try block
- Scourgify: <br>
csv.DictReader, csv.DictWriter, writeheader, writerow
- CS50 P-Shirt:<br>
PIL library, Image and ImageOps methods; <br>
os library: os.path.splitext to determine file ext, 
<br><br>

## Week 7 - Regular Expressions
re library
examine / validating patterns, formats
extract user inputs using matches.groups

#### Problem sets:
- NUMB3RS:<br>
re.search validate input<br>
some unit tests
- Watch on YouTube:<br>
re.search extracting user input<br>
some unit tests
- Working 9 to 5:<br>
more extracting and cleaning inputs<br>
some unit tests
- Regular, um, Expressions:<br>
reading re documentation for exact inputs<br>
some tests
- Response Validation:<br>
after all that, someone wrote a library to simplify all those cryptic symbols. use the library <br>
from validator_collection import checkers
<br><br>

## Week 8 - Object-Oriented Programing
use classes to create objects with their own methods
use decorators "@" to create properties that harden codes: @property (getter) & @class.setter (setter)
validating setter values, raising Error
using @classmethod cls method without init object
inherit methods, varialbes, attributes from superclass
operator overloading

#### Problem sets:
- Seasons of Love:<br>
use ready made object date, read documentation on how to use methods
- Cookie Jar:<br>
make a class with init, str, methods, property, 
- CS50 Shirtificate:<br>
use FPDF library, create classes with nested FDPF methods<br>
read documentation for pdf images, texts<br>
create PDF file outputs
<br><br>

## Week 9 - Et Cetera
#### Other python exclusive features:<br>
set, global variables in classes using global keyword,<br>
typehints in mypy library<br>
docstrings  to create documentation<br>
argparse to check arguements<br>
args and kwargs <br>
lists and dict comprehensions<br>
generators and iterators
<br><br>
